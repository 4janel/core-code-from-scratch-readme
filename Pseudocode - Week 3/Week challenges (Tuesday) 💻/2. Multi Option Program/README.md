# Multi Pption Program

## Description

For this challenge you will create a program with multiple options using Switch (Segun), the options available are the following:

1. Sum two numbers
2. Print the day of the week given the day number
3. Print the length of a given text

This program must have a start menu where the user must select one of the previously described options. When the user selects each of the options, the program will perform the following:

1. Sum. The user enters two numbers and the result of the sum of both is printed
2. Print day of the week. The user enters a day of the week using numbers and the name of the day must be printed. For example, if the number 1 is entered, the program prints the text Lunes.
3. Calculate text length. The user enters a text and the length of the text should be printed. I was able to use the Pseint Longitud function to get the length.
When the user enters an incorrect option, a message should be printed saying that the option is not available.
