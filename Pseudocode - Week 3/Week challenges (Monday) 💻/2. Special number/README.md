# Special Number
## Description

You must create the code that follows the following logic, if the given number is 100, take this number as special and show the following message: "This is a special number!", but if the number is less than 1000, multiple of 10 and different from 100, you must show the following message: "This number is almost special". if none of the given conditions are met show the following message: "Just a regular number". Another developer was trying to program the logic, but apparently couldn't, you need to fix the code to work properly

This was the code from the developer

        Algoritmo specialNumber
            Leer n
            Si n == 100 Entonces
                Imprimir 'This is a special number'
            FinSi
            Si n < 1000 Entonces
                Imprimir ''
            SiNo
                Imprimir 'Just a regular number'
            FinSi
            Si n % 10 == 0 Entonces
                Imprimir 'This number is multiple of 10'
            FinSi
