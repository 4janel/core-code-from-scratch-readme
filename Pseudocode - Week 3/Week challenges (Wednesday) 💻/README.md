# Challenges

## 1. Multiplication Tables

For this challenge you will create a program to calculate the multiplication tables for a given number using While (Mientras). The user must enter a number and then the multiplication table for the number must be printed.

## 2. Simple calculator with Do While

For this challenge we are going to use the simple calculator that we made in the "Simple Calculator" (Challenge 02) but now adding the functionality to perform a calculation again without finishing the program. The program should ask us if we want to use another operation and if the user answers yes then we can perform a new operation. To solve this challenge remember to use Do while (Repetir Hasta Que).
