# Challenges

## 1. The Hashtag Generator

The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

- It must start with a hashtag (`#`).
- All words must have their first letter capitalized.
- If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return `false`.
- If the input or the result is an empty string it must return `false`.

### Examples

```
" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
"    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
""                                        =>  false
```

## 2. String incrementer

Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string.

- If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.
- If the string does not end with a number. the number 1 should be appended to the new string.

### Examples:

`foo-> foo1`

`foobar23 -> foobar24`

`foo0042 -> foo0043`

`foo9 -> foo10`

`foo099 -> foo100`

*Attention: If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.*
