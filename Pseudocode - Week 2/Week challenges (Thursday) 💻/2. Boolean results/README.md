# Boolean results

## Description

You have been assigned to verify and explain a code created by one of your colleagues, the idea is that you can describe the value that each variable has within the code as well as what was done for each line. What is expected of you is that you add comments below each line showing the value that the variable would have and a short explanation of how that value is reached.

This is the code:

    Algoritmo boolean
	    a <- 5 == 3
	    b <- 4 <> 3
	    c <- 7 > 7
	    d <- 4 < 4
	    e <- 100 <= 90
	    f <- 40 >= 40
    FinAlgoritmo

## Solution

	Algoritmo Results
	
		a <- 5 == 3
	  // a = FALSE, comparing if 5 is equal to 3, which results in FALSE
		b <- 4 <> 3
	  // a = TRUE, comparing if 4 is different from 3, which results in TRUE
		c <- 7 > 7
	  // c = FALSE, comparing if 7 is greater than 7, which results in FALSE
		d <- 4 < 4
	  // d = FALSE, comparing if 4 is less than 4, which results in FALSE
		e <- 100 <= 90
	  // e = FALSE, comparing if 100 is less than or equal to 90, which results in FALSE
		f <- 40 >= 40
	  // f = TRUE, comparing if 40 is greater than or equal to 40, which returns TRUE as a result
