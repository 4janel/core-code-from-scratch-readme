# Identify odd and even numbers

## Description

Remember the last challenge about the Mod operator? well, today your task will be to create a program that will be able to detect based on the user input if the number is odd or even. The process should be the following:

The user enters a number
Your algorithm detects if the number is odd or even (remember to use conditional statements Si...Entonces)
Print ‘Número: x es par’ if the number is even (x is the number the user enters)
Print ‘Número: x es impar’ if the number is odd (x is the number the user enters)
