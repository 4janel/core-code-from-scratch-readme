# Logic Problem
## Description

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

    Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".

    Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".

    Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".

    Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".

    Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

## Solution

First, Alice's statement means that everybody studied.

Then Bob said that 1 person studied, but if he is lying, then Alice is lying too.

The next statement by Charlie said that 2 people study, again, if he is lying, Bob too.

Dan said that 3 people studied, then Charlie statement could be false if he is lying.

And finally Eva said that 4 people studied, if it is false, 4 people didn't study.

Then Bob is telling the truth, because he was the only one who studied.
