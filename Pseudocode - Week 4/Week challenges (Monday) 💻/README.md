## 1. Average sales and commission

Make a program that asks how many sales the seller had, Once the number of sales is entered, ask for the value of each sale until all are entered, then return as a result the average value of sales, and the commission that the seller will take, If the seller had more than 5 sales, his commission will be 15% of the total value of the sales, if he sold 5 or less, his commission will be only 10%.

## 2. Even or odd

Request a number from 1 to 50, if the number is not between those values, report the error and request it again until you get a valid number, then it shows on the screen all the numbers from 1 to that number, if the number is even it only shows the even numbers, if it is odd it only shows the odd ones.
