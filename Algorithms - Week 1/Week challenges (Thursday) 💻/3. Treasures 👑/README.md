## Solution

We know that all the messages are lies.

First, we will take the message in the chest 'B' "All these chests have treasures in them." If it isn't true, that means that only one or two chests have treasures.

In the chest 'C' the message say "Only one of these chests has treasures." It means again that only one or two chests have treasures.

And finally we have the last message in chest 'A' "The middle chest has a treasure." Then we identify the two chests with a treasure.

By chest 'A' statement, that means both 'A' and 'C' have treasures.
