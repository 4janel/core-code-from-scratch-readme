# Challenges

## 1. Convert a String to a Number!

We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

**Note:** Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

### Examples

```
"1234" --> 1234
"605"  --> 605
"1405" --> 1405
"-7" --> -7
```

## 2. Convert number to reversed array of digits

Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.

### Example(Input => Output):

```javascript
35231 => [1,3,2,5,3]
0 => [0]
```

## 3. Truthy and Falsy

You are given two empty arrays (`truthy` and `falsy`) and you have to fill this array with at least 5 elements in each which will evaluate to true or false accordingly.

## 4. Training JS #4: Basic data types--Array

I've written five functions. Each function receives a parameter arr which is an array. Complete the functions using arr inside the function bodies.

```javascript
1. getLength(arr)    should return length of arr
2. getFirst(arr)     should return the first element of arr
3. getLast(arr)      should return the last element of arr
4. pushElement(arr)  should push an element to arr, and then return arr
5. popElement(arr)   should pop an element from arr, and then return arr
```
