# Challenges

## 1. Get started with Codewars

## 2. Objects

Give you a function `animal`, accept 1 parameter:`obj` like this:

```javascript
{name:"dog",legs:4,color:"white"}
```

and return a string like this:

`"This white dog has 4 legs."`

```javascript
function animal(obj){
  return ?
}
```

## 3. Return to sanity

This function should return an object, but it's not doing what's intended. What's wrong?

```javascript
function mystery() {
  var results = { sanity: "Hello" };
  return;
  results;
}
```

## 4. Object syntax debug

While making a zork-type game, you create an object of rooms. Unfortunately, the game is not working. Find all of the errors in the rooms object to get your game working again.

```javascript
var rooms = {
  first: {
    description: 'This is the first room'
    items: {
      chair: 'The old chair looks comfortable',
      lamp: 'This lamp looks ancient'
  },
  second: {
    description: 'This is the second room'
    items: {
      couch: 'This couch looks like it would hurt your back,
      table: 'On the table there is an unopened bottle of water'
    }
  }
}
```
